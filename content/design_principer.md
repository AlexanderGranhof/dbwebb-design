    <h1>Why are cats the better pet?</h1>
    <div class="split-container">
        <p>There can be many different reasons why a cat is a better fit pet for most people. The most common argument is that <span class="large-good">cats are cheaper</span> to take care of than a dog. <span class="large-bad">Dogs need constant attention</span>. And if youre in a family where both parents are working full time, the dog will be lonely for most of the day. Cats require barely any attention, they are very capable by themselves and dont need much care. Aslong they have access to water, food and a bathroom they can basically handle themselves.</p>

    <h1>Cats are <span class="huge-good">prettier</span></h1>
    <p>Cats are simple prettier, no one can deny that. Below is a collage of different pictures of cats. I put it into a neat little grid so you can easily admire each and every picture of these pretty cats. Now these cats are actually adults, so not the absolutely cutests cats possible but still given that theyre adults they are still cute little cuddly animals that you can snuggle with.</p>
